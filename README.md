# Diabetes Prediction

This project aims to model the progression of diabetes using the available independent variables. The model will help healthcare professionals understand how different factors influence the progression of diabetes and potentially aid in designing better treatment plans and preventive measures. The model will provide insights into the dynamics of diabetes progression in patients.<br><br><br>
Dataset used is the `Diabetes` dataset available in the `sklearn` library.
